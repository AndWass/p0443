# p0443

This is a playground project to play with a sender/receiver construct, currently
proposed as [P0443](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2020/p0443r13.html) for C++ standardization.

This is not in any way shape or form production-worthy. I wrote this to get a feel for the paradigm
and to play with it.
